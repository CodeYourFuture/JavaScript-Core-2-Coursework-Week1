/*
  For this exercise, the function has been written for you and you need to write
  the tests.

  This function takes a trainee parameter that is an object. The object
  contains: name (which represents the trainee's name) and score (which
  represents the mark given to the trainee's coursework).

  It uses these to format a string that tells the user how much coursework the
  trainee has completed.
