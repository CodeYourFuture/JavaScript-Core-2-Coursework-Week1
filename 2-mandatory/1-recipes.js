/*
  The Recipe Card
  Never forget another recipe!

  Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe.

  It should have properties for

  - title (a string),
  - servings (a number), and
  - ingredients (an array of strings)

  On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:

  Mole
  Serves: 2
  Ingredients:
  cinnamon
  cumin
  cocoa

  You should write and log at least 5 recipes
*/

// write code here

let recipe1 = {
  title: "Mole",
  servings: 2,
  ingredients: ["cinnamon", "cumin", "cocoa"]
}
console.log(recipe1);

let recipe2 = {
  title: "Tea", 
  servings: 1,
  ingredients: ["tea", "water", "milk"]
}
console.log(recipe2);


let recipe3 = {
  title: "pancakes",
  servings: 4, 
  ingredients: ["milk", "flour", "water", "eggs", "butter"]
}
console.log(recipe3);


let recipe4 = {
  title: "toastWithJam",
