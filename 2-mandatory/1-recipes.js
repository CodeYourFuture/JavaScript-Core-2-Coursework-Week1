/*
  The Recipe Card
  Never forget another recipe!

  Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe.

  It should have properties for

  - title (a string),
  - servings (a number), and
  - ingredients (an array of strings)

  On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:

  Mole
  Serves: 2
  Ingredients:
  cinnamon
  cumin
  cocoa

  You should write and log at least 5 recipes
*/

// write code here

let recipe = {
  title : "mole" ,
  serves : 2 ,
  ingredients : ["cinnamon" , "cumin" , "cocoa"]
}
for(let i in recipe)
 console.log(recipe[i]);
