/*
  You have a pantry object that tells you the contents of your fridge and your cupboards.

  Write a function createShoppingList that takes a recipe as a parameter.
  The recipe parameter has two properties:
    - "name", which is a string
    - "ingredients", which is an array of strings

  The createShoppingList function should find which ingredients from the recipe are missing from the pantry.

  The createShoppingList function should return an object with two properties:
    - "name" of the recipe, which is a string,
    - "items", which is an arry of the missing ingredients that need to be on the shopping list

  fridgeContents: ["butter", "milk"],
