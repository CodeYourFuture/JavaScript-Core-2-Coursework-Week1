/*
  Objects can be thought of as key/value storage, like a dictionary or a 'lookup'.

  You have a variable called COUNTRY_CURRENCY_CODES which is an array of arrays.
  Each inner array contains a country code and its currency code.

  Write a function called createLookup that
    - takes COUNTRY_CURRENCY_CODES as an argument (remember, it's an array of arrays)
    - returns a new object where the keys are the country codes and the values are the currency codes
    Hint: you'll need to use bracket notation to add new key/value pairs to the object
*/

const COUNTRY_CURRENCY_CODES = [
  ["GB", "GBP"],
  ["DE", "EUR"],
  ["NG", "NGN"],
  ["MX", "MXN"],
];

function createLookup(countryCurrencyCodes) {
  // write code here
}
