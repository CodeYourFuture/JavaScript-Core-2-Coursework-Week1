/*
  This exercise is to write function that counts the number of times each word appears in a string.

  Write a function called countWords that
    - takes a string as an argument
    - returns an object where
          - the keys are the words from the string and
          - the values are the number of times the word appears in the string

  Example
  If the function is given the input:

  "you and me and you";

  the object returned would be:

  { you: 2, and: 2, me: 1 }

  To complete this exercise you should understand
    - Strings and string manipulation
    - Loops or forEach
    - Comparison inside if statements
    - Setting values on an object
*/

function countWords(string) {
  const wordCount = {};

  // write code here

  return wordCount;
}
